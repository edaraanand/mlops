Feature Selection is very important concept
  We need huge data, accurate data, right feature selection.

There are 2 types
1) Manual
2) Programming

Its hard to remove the unwanted data in manual process so we need programmatic way.

Programming has 3 types
1) Filter Method
2) Wrapper Method
3) Embedded Method

Filter Method:
  What are the inputs/features effecting the output/feature, We need to consider all of them.

So we need correlation correlation

1) correlation
  ds.corr()
  1   : High
  0   : NAN
  -1  : Negligible

2) Then we need variance
  s=VarianceThreshold(threshold=0)  #s is just  variable storing the algorithm.
  s.fit(ds) #fits dataset inside this algorithm | train the model
  s.get_support() #will tell you if your column should be a feature or not | prediction

  Threshold varies based on the number of constant data.

  threshold=0 for the constant data
  threshold=10% for the quasi constant variable

Multi Linear Regression
  Where you have more than one feature to define the prediction.
  After feature selection done, keep the features selected in a new variable and use train_test_split() function.
  Anything above 80 % is good.

Computer Vision

  Video is a stream of photos
  You can capture a photo using cv2 library

  import cv2
  frame = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
  status, photo = frame.read()
  cv2.imshow('hi', photo)
  cv2.waitkey()
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()

If we want a video then use loops and break statement wherever needed.
  while true:
    above logic
If we want to get smooth video then pass wait time
  cv2.waitkey(100)
If we want to interput the infinite loop
  if cv2.waitkey(100) == 13:
    break
If we want to resize
  cv2.resize(photo, (100,100))
If we want to crop
  photo[100:400, 200:500]
